Typical workflow
================

1. Put a folder with photos named like '2019-10-25'
2. Create a file descript.ion in it. For Windows use `dir /B > descript.ion`
3. If you have images from different sources you may want to order them by time of creation not by name. Use `python sortbyexifdate.py` to order by the date from EXIF.
